# Overview of the Project

### Project : Natural Language Processing (NLP) Application

## Objectives
This project aims to develop an NLP application that analyzes and processes text data. The application will perform text preprocessing and implement advanced NLP models to extract meaningful patterns and insights from textual inputs. It is designed to handle various use cases, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or information retrieval.

## Key Activites
  - Text Data Processing
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model training and Evaluation
  - Application Development
  - Deployment and Testing

## Technologies Used
  -Programming Languages:
      Python (primary language for NLP libraries and model implementation).
  -Libraries and Frameworks:
      Text Preprocessing: NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob.
      Word Embeddings: Gensim (Word2Vec, GloVe), FastText.
      Deep Learning Models: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras.
      Other NLP Tools: Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers.
  -Data Storage and Processing:
      Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
      SQLite, PostgreSQL for database integration.
  -API Development:
      Flask for building RESTful APIs.
  -Visualization Tools:
      Matplotlib, Seaborn for analysis and model insights.
  -Deployment:
      Docker for containerization.
      Kubernetes for orchestration.
      Cloud services for scalability (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)

### Project : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

## Objectives 
This project focuses on implementing a simple linear regression model to analyze relationships between a dependent continuous variable and one or more independent variables. It demonstrates the process of creating, training, and evaluating a predictive model. The ultimate goal is to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy and visualize its predictions against actual values.

## Key Activities
  -Data Preparation
  -Model Training
  -Model Evaluation
  -Visiulisation
  -Prediction
  
## Technologies Used
